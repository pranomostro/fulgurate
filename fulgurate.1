.Sh NAME
.Nm fulgurate
.Nd simple spaced repetition flashcard software

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Simple spaced repetition flashcard software. Flashcards are
stored in a simple text format and the code is small enough to
be easily modifiable. The spaced repetition algorithm is SM-2
(http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm). See the python files or
the man pages for usage of the programs. See the SM-2 website for more
details on the algorithm and the scale of the user self-evaluation input.

.Sh DATA
Flashcards have two parts, corresponding to the top and bottom of a
card. The input to fulgurate-import should contain tab-separated two
columns for the top and bottom fields respectively. The flashcard files
themselves (produced by fulgurate-import) are similar but include the
card state.

.Sh EXAMPLE
An example of common usage is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Create a flashcard set
.Dl $ fulgurate-import example.tsv example.cards
.Dl # Run the flashcards in the terminal
.Dl $ fulgurate-run example.cards
.Dl # Show the current scheduling for the cards
.Dl $ fulgurate-show-schedule example.cards
.Pp
The included example.tsv file is sample card data consisting of
a few Chinese-English dictionary entries from CC-CEDICT. The files
example-filter.sh and example-finish.sh are for fulgurate-runs -f and
-F options respectively, and are designed to work with the same data.
